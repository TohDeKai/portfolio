            Back in 2020, I got an opportunity to develop a landing page during
            my UI/UX internship stint at Calibrate. That was the first time I
            started learning coding and found that I enjoyed it a lot and
            decided to pursue a bachelor&apos;s of computing.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Since then, I&apos;ve continued exploring different fields through
            several roles - from project management, UI/UX to software
            engineering.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            When I&apos;m not at my desk, I like to keep myself busy through an
            active lifestyle - aiming to complete a sub-5 hour marathon in 2024
