            Back in 2020, I got an opportunity to develop a landing page during
            my UI/UX internship stint at Calibrate. That was the first time I
            started learning coding and found that I enjoyed it a lot and
            decided to pursue a bachelor's of computing.

            Since then, I've continued exploring different fields through
            several roles - Product Development Intern at Skilio, Project
            Management Intern at Zalora, Software Engineering Intern at GovTech,
            Frontend Developer at NUS institute of data science and even a
            Coding Instructor role at A Posteriori.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            When I'm not at my desk, I like to keep myself busy through an
            active lifestyle - aiming to complete a sub-5 hour marathon in 2024
