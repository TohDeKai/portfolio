          Back in 2020, I got an opportunity to develop a landing page during my
          UI/UX internship stint at Calibrate. That was the first time I started
          learning coding and found that I enjoyed it a lot and decided to
          pursue a bachelor&apos;s of computing.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Since then, I&apos;ve continued exploring different fields through
          several roles - from project management, UI/UX to software
          engineering.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          When I&apos;m not at my desk, I like to keep myself busy through an
          active lifestyle - aiming to complete a sub-5 hour marathon in 2024
